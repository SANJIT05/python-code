Control and Coordination
111
If it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise
quantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing
and amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms.
For example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the
cells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the
blood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.

What you have learnt
?
n
Control and coordination are the functions of the nervous system and hormones
in our bodies.
n
The responses of the nervous system can be classified as reflex action, voluntary
action or involuntary action.
n
The nervous system uses electrical impulses to transmit messages.
n
The nervous system gets information from our sense organs and acts through our
muscles.
n
Chemical coordination is seen in both plants and animals.
n
Hormones produced in one part of an organism move to another part to achieve
the desired effect.
n
A feedback mechanism regulates the action of the hormones.
