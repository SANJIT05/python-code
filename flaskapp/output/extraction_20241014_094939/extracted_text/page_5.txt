Sources of Natural Materials
We are 
oranges. We 
grow on 
orange trees. 
We use many kinds of materials in our life. Nature is the source of 
all of them (e.g., tree). From these natural sources man makes many 
materials (e.g., wooden planks)  which are used to make many other 
things (e.g., wooden basket).
The sources of natural materials are plants, animals, rocks and soil.
