From Silk
From Leather
From Wool
The jute ﬁbre is long, shiny and strong. Silk is the strongest natural ﬁbre. 
We make many things like bags, mats and sarees from these ﬁbres. 
Wool keeps us warm; so sweaters, caps and socks are knitted using it. 
Leather is ﬂexible; so belts, watch straps and bags are made from it.
