Th e Exciting World of Origami Butterfl ies
Special Butterﬂ y Names
special folding friends
become part of the table
and never leave us
From the beginning, Michael has named his favorite 
origami butterfl y designs for the folding pioneers who 
spread the joy of origami through their creating, trave-
ling, and teaching. Sometimes when he is exploring new 
combinations, proportions, and details, and he discovers 
something beautiful and unique, it can spontaneously 
remind him of a special origami ambassador, and then 
he names the piece for them. While it is diffi  cult for him 
to explain, he does not set out to design a butterfl y for a 
specifi c person, but rather, names a butterfl y design only 
when it feels right.
