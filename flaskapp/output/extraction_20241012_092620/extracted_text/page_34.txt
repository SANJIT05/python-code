Wing Styles and Variations 
Right angles are unusual in nature’s creatures, so your but-
terfl y will look less artifi cial aft er you soft en any perpen-
dicular lines. Finishing the outer edges of the wings with 
special, folded treatments oft en takes advantage of the excess 
paper temporarily stowed in the margins and corners during 
the initial setup. Pull this excess paper out to create color 
change spots, patterns, or prongs. Another popular treatment 
involves shaping the tip of the forewing corner, oft en with a 
fold-over, inside-reverse, or even a small rabbit-ear fold. 
Th ese designs feature several favorite treatments, including 
rows of contrasting color triangles (“Aztec,” as seen in “Th e 
Cashdollar,” page 103), pivoting fanfolds (see “Th e June,” page 
94), color-change frame surrounds (see “Th e Jan,” page 44), 
swallowtails (see “Th e Guy Kawasaki Swallowtail,” page 78), 
pronghorns (see “Th e Lang,” page 54), as well as regular, and 
irregular polygonal spots. Th ese are just a few, so rest assured 
as you embark on your journey that there are plenty more to 
discover. We tend to favor the fi nished look of folded edges, 
but a splendid row of triangular spots from simple fan-fold-
ing can also be quite striking. Th e following illustration shows 
just a few of the wing shaping options.
