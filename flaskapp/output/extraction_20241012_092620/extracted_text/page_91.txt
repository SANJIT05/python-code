A Butterﬂ y for Doris Asano
Th is design is named for Doris Asano, the chief 
organizer of avid Arizona paper folders. She is 
the person responsible for bringing us to Phoenix 
for advanced paper folding workshops. Th e fi rst 
visit lead to our big origami art exhibition at the 
Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum in Tucson, and 
50,000 fans! 
“Th e Doris” butterfl y loves to laugh in the sun-
shine. She enjoys visiting all of her desert friends, 
and gets excited when rare rains make the desert 
burst into bloom. “Th e Doris” takes good care of 
visiting butterfl ies from near and far. All are wel-
come and are immediately drawn into her laugh-
ter and friendship. 
friendship is like air
without friends, we can’t exist
breathe deeply today
Th is design will introduce a diff erent forewing 
shape.

The Danaus plexippus (Monarch) butterﬂ y was the real 
world inspiration for this model.
