Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
68
A Butterﬂ y for Eric Joisel
“Th e Joisel”
Named for the late Eric Joisel, Parisian sculptor turned origami master who stunned the origami 
world with his high level of technical and artistic achievement, this Papillon pour Eric embodies the 
spirit of our genius-artist-sculptor-clown. 
He can make paper do anything, even fold itself. He travels the world, proclaiming himself “silly 
and stupid” while doing what no one else can even imagine doing. Th e “Butterfl y for Eric” (Papillon 
pour Eric) elicits music from the gnomes, and lights the morning sky to make the paper rooster crow. 
the “clay” in your hands
became thousands of folders
your hands warmed clay hearts!
