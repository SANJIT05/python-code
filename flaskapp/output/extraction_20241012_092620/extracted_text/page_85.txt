Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
82
The Origamido Butterﬂ y 
Th is special design is named for the Origamido Studio. “Th e Origamido Butterfl y” has seg-
mented wings, clean lines, and a color-change body. Th e distinctive shape made this design a 
clear choice for our Origamido Studio logo, because it was elegant, confi dent, fi nished, and 
free—so diff erent from traditional attempts at origami butterfl ies, which oft en seemed un-
fi nished or even tortured.
Origamido!
paper folding is the craft  
“do,” a life’s journey!
Th is design introduces the “Origamido Butterfl y Base,” and a diff erent style of fi nishing the but-
terfl y’s head.
1. Begin with the major color facing up. Valley-
fold the paper in half, edge to edge. Unfold.
2. Valley-fold two opposite edges to meet at 
the crease.
3. Valley-fold the paper in half, bottom edge 
to top.
The Morpho didius (Giant Blue Morpho) butterﬂ y was the real 
world inspiration for this model.
