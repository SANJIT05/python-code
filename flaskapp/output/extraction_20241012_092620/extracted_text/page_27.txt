When preparing a base, place the fi rst fold, or “horizon” crease, 
along the center by matching the lower edge to the upper edge 
(just fold the sheet in half). Th is is the butterfl y’s “waistline,” 
separating forewings from hindwings. (A short portion will 
become the head and abdomen). Sharp creases are essential, so 
burnish every crease with the back of your thumbnail. (Or use a 
folding tool, a “bone folder,” or even the bowl of a spoon. Do not 
use anything that can bruise or mar the paper’s surface.) Placing 
the horizon crease above the center of the square will create 
smaller forewings and larger hindwings; placing it below will do 
the reverse. Open the paper. Keep the horizon crease horizontal. 
Th ere are many ways to form margins that result in a rectan-
gle of suitable proportion. When measuring distances along the 
edge of the square, we like to make a short pinch as a reference 
mark at the edge (do not make a full length crease). Beginners 
may prefer to pinch a reference point along the other edge too, 
especially when folding a narrow margin fl ap accurately.
OPPOSITE LEFT AND RIGHT These early steps determine many possible 
outcomes. The photos show the initial set-up decisions (at left), and the 
resulting bases (at right) for some favorite butterﬂ y models.
BELOW These diagrams show how to fold different proportions that con-
tribute to the wide variety of origami butterﬂ y bases from which to choose.
