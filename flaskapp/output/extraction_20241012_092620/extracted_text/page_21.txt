Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
18
Getting Started
All you need is a rectangle. Michael folded his fi rst 
original origami butterfl y for Alice Gray in 1978 from a 
discarded piece of pink offi  ce paper on the subway. You 
can generate many suitable rectangles just by folding in 
the opposite edges of a square. 
Th ese butterfl y designs show both sides of the sheet, 
and you will fi nd many kinds of paper that make beau-
tiful butterfl ies. So-called “regular” origami paper has 
color on only one side (it’s white on the other). We 
folded with regular origami paper to demonstrate each 
project on the accompanying DVDs. 
Origami paper now comes in a 
remarkable number of “Duo” 
color and print forms.
