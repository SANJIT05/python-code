A Butterﬂ y for Kyoto
Just before this book was printed, I was inspired by a pending trip to Kyoto, Japan. I 
designed this new butterfl y with the city’s history of the Japanese folding fan, and 
the lovely Yuzen fabric and papers, for which they are famous. 
shimmering city 
fragrant home of the geisha
