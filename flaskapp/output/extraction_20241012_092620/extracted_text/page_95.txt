Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
92
A Butterﬂ y for V’Ann Cornelius
Named for the late V’Ann Cornelius, 
folder and origami art curator respon-
sible for art exhibitions at numerous 
origami conventions, and at the Min-
gei Museum in San Diego, California; 
Hangar Ten in Salzburg, Austria; and 
for several other shows and exhibits. 
“Th e V’Ann” loves to put on a show. 
She will direct the talent, and expertly 
determine what goes where, how, and 
when. Her x-ray vision sees inner 
beauty, besides knowing which is the 
best side to display. She makes sure the 
exhibits are spotless, adjusts the lights, 
raises the pedestal, and places the fresh-
est fl owers at either side. 
send me the best work
raise it to the high platform
come, look at it now!
Th is design will introduce color-change 
fl aps for the top paper.
