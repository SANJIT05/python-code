Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
Th e origami diagrams used in this book are an effi  cient, internationally standardized system of lines and arrows, 
dots, dashes, and a few other symbols. Although simple, it is not immediately intuitive, so please invest a few mo-
ments to study the key, and refer back to it as needed. Become familiar with the symbols and what they mean. As 
you watch the DVDs, look at the corresponding diagrams in the book to reinforce your understanding. For effi  -
ciency, a diagram may contain more than one instruction, so check carefully for details you might have overlooked 
at fi rst. If you are unsure of a step, glancing ahead to the next step oft en reveals the desired shape, and may provide 
other valuable clues. For your comfort, rotate the paper away from you as you fold it (even though the diagrams 
won’t always show the object rotated), and then return it to the position shown in the diagram as you compare the 
shapes. Once you learn this elegant diagramming system, you’ll be able to enjoy countless origami books.
