Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
22
The Base Architecture 
No matter how simple or complex any of the butterfl ies from our system 
may be, they each display many of the distinguishing features of their liv-
ing counterparts: head, thorax, abdomen, forewings, and hindwings. 
1. (A) Valley-fold in half, long edge to long

4. The squash fold almost complete. Press 
ﬂ at.
10. The squash fold in progress. Press ﬂ at.
2. Squash-fold the right half. Look ahead at 
steps 3–5 to understand the process.
8. Valley-fold the bottom corner to the top of 
the split. Unfold.
9. Squash-folding the right and left halves to 
form the wings.
5. Your paper should look like this. Turn over,

You will soon be defi ning all of these 
exciting features, but we need to begin 
with the foundation of the basic archi-
tecture that Michael developed in 1978 
with his Butterfl y for Alice Gray (page 
34). Find a piece of letter paper and 
fold along with us as shown in the next 
few diagrams.
