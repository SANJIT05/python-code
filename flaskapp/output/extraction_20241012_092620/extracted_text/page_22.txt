Getting Started
Origami paper with two (non-white) 
colors is called “duo.” You can fold 
great looking butterfl ies from any two-
colored paper: regular or duo origami 
papers, paper-backed foils, two-color 
(duo) foils, duo prints, or print / solid 
duo papers. Enjoy practicing with 
scraps of gift  wrap, colorful junk mail, 
or even packaging such as candy wrap-
pers. 
If you want your butterfl ies to last 
without fading, turning yellow, or 
becoming brittle, then be sure to use 
premium fi ber papers marked “archi-
val,” or “acid free.” Papers that have 
been pigmented with colorfast artist-
quality materials last the longest. 
Play money and candy 
wrappers are trans-
formed by origami.
Foil gift wrap makes a stunning display when folded into origami 
butterﬂ ies, and will serve well as a substitute for a package bow.
