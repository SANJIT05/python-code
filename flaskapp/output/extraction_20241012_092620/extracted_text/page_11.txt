Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
8
The Exciting World 
of Origami Butterﬂ ies
by Richard Alexander, Origamido Studio Cofounder
Th is book contains print and video instructions for folding Michael G. 
LaFosse’s favorite origami butterfl y designs. We chose a new selection of 
models to illustrate his origami butterfl y design system, a series of decisions 
and techniques that will allow you to discover an unlimited variety of but-
terfl y “species” by mixing and matching folding maneuvers. Not only do the 
printed diagrams show how to fold them, the companion video DVDs show 
Michael explaining the steps as he folds. He also demonstrates wet-folding 
techniques (for creating lasting works of art from fi ne papers).
