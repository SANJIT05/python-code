10. Squash-fold the right half.
11. Valley-fold the bottom corner to the top of 
the split. Unfold.
12. One at a time, squash-fold the right and 
left halves of the model to form the wings. 
Look ahead at step 13 for the results.
13. Form a crimped overlap at the middle 
of each wing by rolling the top edges and 
the bottom edges of each wing towards the 
center. (The excess paper pushes up the 
center mountain crease to form an edge.) 
Fold the forewing paper down over the hind-
wing, creating the forewing overlap.
16. Valley-fold the new top corners of the 
forewings to the crease. Inside-reverse-fold 
the square corners to form the left and right 
wing notches.
14. Your paper should look like this.
17. Tuck the raw edges of the top shape 
under the leading edges of each forewing. 
15. Valley-fold the top corners of the fore-
wings to touch the crease line.
18. Mountain-fold the upper corner of the 
hindwings behind. Valley-fold the bottom cor-
ner of the hindwings to touch the crease line.
