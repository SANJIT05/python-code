Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
34
A Butterﬂ y for Alice Gray
“Th e Alice” 
Th is design is named for the late Alice Gray, entomological assistant, avid folder, teacher, and origami 
proponent. She was a crucial ally in bringing the offi  ces of the national folding organization to the 
American Museum of Natural History in New York City. 
Th is design was Michael’s fi rst original origami butterfl y, and so “Th e Alice” is our matriarch of the 
family, having given life to the others that followed. She knows what makes them fl ap, and where to 
locate the best host plants for lunch. “Th e Alice” travels the world, introducing the joy of origami to 
the scientifi c types, while she also excites young children as they open their eyes to the natural won-
ders around them. 
oh Lady of Bugs
showing knowledge conquers fear
hugging millipede!
Th is design introduces the breadth of the potential of Michael’s system. Explore the permutations and 
combinations possible from choosing diff erent arrangements of margin fl aps and corners, sometimes 
with beveled corners. Use a square (four to ten inches works best with most papers). A six-inch square 
produces a four-inch butterfl y.
