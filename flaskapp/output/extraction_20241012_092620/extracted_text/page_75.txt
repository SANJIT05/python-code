A Butterﬂ y for Sok Song
“Th e Sok”
Th is design is named for Sok Song, designer and creator of Creased maga-
zine, talented artist, author, folder, and friend. 
“Th e Sok” is simply elegant. Th e clean lines and pleasing shapes transmit 
a no-nonsense message: We are not alone in the world. We are not hermits. 
It does matter how you look, and how you carry yourself. People notice!
black cat sits alone
eyes glowing, moonlight slivers
he works all night long!
Th is design will introduce the “Cat’s Eye” pattern, and the artful use of the 
lunule. 
The Limenitis arthemis (White Admiral) 
butterﬂ y was the real world inspiration 
for this model.
