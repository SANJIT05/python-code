A Butterﬂ y for Robert Lang
“Th e Lang”
Th is butterfl y is named for Robert Lang, a LASER optics physicist, en-
gineer, designer, author, and artist—best known for bridging the gap 
between disciplines—who is also a Board member of Origami USA. His 
work makes artists’ origami more thoughtful and planned, while coaxing 
engineers to make their origami a bit more artful. 
And so the “Th e Lang” butterfl y is our Senior Science Offi  cer, the logical, 
rational, even-tempered arbiter of all that is too complex for mere mortals. 
if it can be done
I’ll enjoy all the hard work
it will be so cool!
Th is design will introduce another style of thorax, as well as the “prongtail” 
hindwing.
