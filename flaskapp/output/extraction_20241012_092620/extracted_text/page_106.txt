A Butterﬂ y for Russell Cashdollar
Th is design is a version of the “Joyce Rockmore” butterfl y that we named for 
Russell Cashdollar, origami designer . “Th e Cashdollar” pays homage to Rus-
sell’s colorful origami butterfl y displays that we saw at the 1992 origami con-
vention in New York City. It has fanciful color-change spots, and a proportion 
reminiscent of the design that Russell was exploring decades ago. His display 
inspired Michael to develop his own origami butterfl y design system.

for Joyce Rockmore” (featured in the Origami Butterfl ies kit, Tuttle Publishing, 
2009) and related variations.

serves as the real world inspiration 
for this model.
