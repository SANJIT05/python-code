A Butterﬂ y for Jan Polish 
“Th e Jan” 
Th is design is named for our longtime 
leader at Origami USA; a folder, designer, 
and facilitator who’s carrying on the tra-
ditions of Lillian Oppenheimer through 
her extensive travels and superb teaching 
skills. 
“Th e Jan” is our resourceful rock that 
we all count on for instant answers.

see what we have done!
Th is design will introduce you to the ef-
fect achieved by not beveling the margins’ 
corners, while keeping them on the out-
side instead of tucking them in. It also 
introduces a framed wing treatment that 
we love to use for showcasing fancy papers 
with a restrained contrasting border.
