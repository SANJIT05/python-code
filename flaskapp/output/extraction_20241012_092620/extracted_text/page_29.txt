Th e photos to the left  show some of the 
most common base variables.
LEFT In the top example you can see the effect 
of beveling the corners of the visible ﬂ ap: trian-
gular eyespots appear on the forewings. 
BELOW LEFT Each setup will always provide 
you with two alternatives: fold in half to the 
front (for the result on the right) or fold in half 
to the back (for the result on the left). A differ-
ent base results in each case.
BOTTOM There are numerous combinations 
and possibilities regarding the orientation and 
size of margin ﬂ aps and corners. The margin 
ﬂ aps can be folded to the front, to the back, or 
with one on each side. The most versatile ini-
tial setup approximates the ratio of the Golden 
Rectangle, and when you fold over a pair of 3/16 
ﬂ aps, the resulting rectangle’s ratio of length to 
width will be within 2% of the Golden propor-
tion! We routinely do this by ﬁ rst pinching 
marks at the ¼, and at 1/8 positions, and then 
by aligning one pinch on top of the other, and 
creasing all the way across the square (along 
the midpoint between the two reference pinch 
marks), you will have deﬁ ned a ﬂ ap measuring 
3/16 as wide as the square. Repeat with the op-
posite edge. Some designs require the corners 
of these margins to be folded—some to the 
outside, others tucked beneath.
