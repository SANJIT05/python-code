bearing wings, and viewers don’t just understand origami, they fall in love with it. “Th e Vanessa” 
slips into screening rooms, movie theaters, TV sets, and computer screens everywhere, telling truth 
and beauty, magic and wonder. Th rough her perseverance, remarkable courage, and selfl ess sacri-
fi ce, she makes it cool for kids to question, think, work hard, and explore.
