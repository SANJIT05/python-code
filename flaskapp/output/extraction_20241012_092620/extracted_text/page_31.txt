Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
28
Permutations of this base (for the Butterfl y for Alice Gray—page 34) can be generated from a variety of margin and 
corner choices. Th ree major categories of crease patterns defi ne the resulting permutations. Th e “A” series all have 
rectangular margin fl aps. Th e “B” series shows the possibilities when the corners of only one fl ap are beveled. For 
each folding plan, the front view (left ) and back view (right), appear above their associated preliminary folds.
