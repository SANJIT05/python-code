A Butterﬂ y for Tony Cheng
“Cheng’s Viceroy” 
Th is design is named for our longtime friend, Tony Cheng; Origami USA Board member, folder, crea-
tor, teacher, and tireless origami enthusiast. He came up with this variation of “Th e Alice,” and so we 
named it for him. 
You’ll most likely fi nd “Cheng’s Viceroy” feeding on a red hot chili pepper plant! Whether or not 
you can take the heat, he will be your steady friend. Witty and smart, kind and courageous, “Cheng’s 
Viceroy” also guards the Gold Mine and manages its riches, harvesting donations and surplus materi-
als once each year at the New York Convention for the benefi t of the swarm.
