A Butterﬂ y for Mr. Makoto Yamaguchi 
“Th e Makoto Cho”
Th is butterfl y is named for Mr. Makoto Yamaguchi, “Gallery Origami House” founder, author, 
origami designer and publisher. Mr. Yamaguchi is the beloved mentor and chief organizer of 
publications by wonderfully advanced, “supercomplex” origami designers and folders in Japan 
and throughout the world. 
my youngest folders
are quite talented indeed!
how far will they go?
Th is design will introduce staggered fl aps and an Aztec wing. It also features a special hindwing 
detail obtained by folding a Rabbit’s Ear, and so we call it a Rabbit Spot!
