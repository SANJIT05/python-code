Lunule
A lunule is a simple, crescent-shaped reversal along the edge 
between the two layers that exposes the contrasting color 
when both layers of paper are the same color. Th is striking 
sliver formed by rolling the edge can be applied on either the 
forewing or hindwing.
Swallowtail 
One of the most elegant shapes for the hindwing tips is a 
simple, mountain fold with an outward curl—a swallowtail. 
Wet folding will allow you to shape it easily. Moisten the 
paper slightly with a fi ne mist or damp cloth, and allow the 
moisture to penetrate before you shape the piece. Restrain 
the shaped paper in the desired position with a strip of cloth 
as it dries, to make the shape permanent. Too much moisture 
may abrade the surface or cause it to look fuzzy. (If you are 
uncomfortable with wet-folding, then fold foil swallowtails. 
Th ey will hold their shape without any need for water!)
Aztec
Simple fan-folding along a diagonal produces rows of regular, 
alternating, triangular spots—the Aztec wing treatment. Th e 
Aztecs and others throughout the history of art produced de-
signs featuring this popular motif. (Th e Z sound in the word 
“Aztec” helps our young students remember the zig-zagged, 
triangular pattern).
