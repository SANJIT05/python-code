Michael LaFosseâ€™s Origami Butterfl ies

The Mudarri Luna Moth
Th is design is named for Greg Mudarri, who 
picked up a magazine and was instantly cap-
tivated by a haunting image on the cover: a 
human riding a paper crane! He sought out 
the Origamido Studio for folding lessons, and 
soon became our good friend and helped us 
with graphic art. Greg is also an origami crea-
tor and he taught many lessons at the Origa-
mido Studio, covering for us during our trav-
els. He enjoys working and teaching in Japan. 
Th e Mudarri Luna Moth stays out all 
night, and is attracted to the bright lights of 
the Ginza and loud music with a strong beat.
ride a paper crane?
I could not believe my eyes!
off  to catch my own!
Th is design will introduce a diff erent propor-
tion that creates longer hindwings, and a dif-
ferent treatment for color change on the abdo-
men. It will also introduce the moth head.
The Actias luna (Luna) moth was the real world 
inspiration for this model.
