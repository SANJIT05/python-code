Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies

A Butterﬂ y for Killian Mansﬁ eld
“Th e Killian”
Th is design is named for the late Killian Mansfi eld, a friendly soul we felt we had always 
known. Th is young, advanced origami enthusiast caused us to refl ect on what is truly im-
portant. Diagnosed with a rare synovial cancer at age eleven, Killian endured operations, 
medications, and therapies, one aft er another, for much of his short life. Determined to 
experience all the living any normal young person enjoys, he kept learning and growing 
between visits to the experts. We met him only a few months before he passed, and were 
deeply moved by his enthusiasm and energy. He gave up playing the violin when it became 
too painful to hold it to his chin, and so he learned to strum the ukelele instead. Captivated 
by the wonder of art, he focused on blues music and advanced origami. He even cut a[n] 
ukelele blues CD, working with a host of famous blues musicians to help raise money to fi ght 
childhood cancers. Learn about the Killian Mansfi eld Foundation at killianmansfi eld.org.
When you fold “Th e Killian” you honor the child in us longing to be fully alive. Take ad-
vantage of today, and do something special for the other Killians fi ghting to be just like us!

over the right wing.

wing. Unfold.
