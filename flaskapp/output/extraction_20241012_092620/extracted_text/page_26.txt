Th e Base Architecture
RIGHT Some rectangles, such as those used for most paper 
money, will produce bases with top-layers that extend beyond 
the normal wing margins of the base, and will usually provide no 
margin of paper for the head and thorax. However, you can make 
a head/thorax margin out of the upper 5th of the body paper, as 
shown in step 3, and you will need to form a crimp, as shown in 
steps 4 and 5, to differentiate the forewings and hindwings.
1. Fold in half, bottom to top.
2. Squash-fold, and then ﬂ ip and repeat on 
the reverse.
3. Valley-fold the bottom corner to the top 
of the split. Unfold. Squash-fold the left and 
right halves to form the wings.
4. Move the top layers of each hindwing up-
ward. Mountain-fold the existing horizontal 
crease and add a valley fold below, forming 
a crimp in the middle of each wing.
5. Inside-reverse-fold the corners of each 
wing.
6. The “Dollar Bill Butterﬂ y Base.” Complete 
the butterﬂ y by following ﬁ nishing steps for 
other projects described in the book.
