Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
98
A Butterﬂ y for Anne LaVin 
Th is design is named for Anne LaVin, origami creator, teacher, cyber-world master of ori-
gami websites and our new digital realities. 
“Th e Anne” is our keeper of the cyber-keys, as comfortable in the computer ether as she 
is in the sheet-forming vat technologies of two thousand years ago. “Th e Anne” is at ease 
in the MIT or New York City classroom as she is on the high seas. 
sails ships on high seas 
bytes and chips, learns Japanese
all this, for pond weed!
Th is design will introduce an inside-reverse swivel for a distinctive, geometric look. As dia-
gramed, the model displays the hindwing confi guration of my original gift  to Anne. How-
ever, the example shown below has the hindwing pockets turned inside out, a popular and 
elegant variation that I demonstrate on the second DVD.
