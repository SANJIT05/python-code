Most people are surprised to learn that the world’s largest publisher of 
books on Asia had its humble beginnings in the tiny American state 
of Vermont. Th e company’s founder, Charles Tuttle, came from a New 
England family steeped in publishing, and his fi rst love was books—
especially old and rare editions.
Tuttle’s father was a noted antiquarian dealer in Rutland, Vermont. 
Young Charles honed his knowledge of the trade working in the family 
bookstore, and later in the rare books section of Columbia University 
Library. His passion for beautiful books—old and new—never 
wavered throughout his long career as a bookseller and publisher.
Aft er graduating from Harvard, Tuttle enlisted in the military and 
in 1945 was sent to Tokyo to work on General Douglas MacArthur’s 
staff . He was tasked with helping to revive the Japanese publishing 
industry, which had been utterly devastated by the war. When his tour 
of duty was completed, he left  the military, married a talented and 
beautiful singer, Reiko Chiba, and in 1948 began several successful 
business ventures.
To his astonishment, Tuttle discovered that postwar Tokyo was 
actually a book-lover’s paradise. He befriended dealers in the Kanda 
district and began supplying rare Japanese editions to American 
 libraries. He also imported American books to sell to the thousands 
of GIs stationed in Japan. By 1949, Tuttle’s business was thriving, 
and he opened Tokyo’s very fi rst English-language bookstore in the 
Takashimaya Department Store in Ginza, to great success. Two years 
later, he began publishing books to fulfi ll the growing interest of 
foreigners in all things Asian.
Th ough a westerner, Tuttle was hugely instrumental in bringing a 
knowledge of Japan and Asia to a world hungry for information about 
the East. By the time of his death in 1993, he had published over 6,000 
books on Asian culture, history and art—a legacy honored by Emperor 
Hirohito in 1983 with the “Order of the Sacred Treasure,” the highest 
honor Japan can bestow upon a non-Japanese.
Th e Tuttle company today maintains an active backlist of some 
1,500 titles, many of which have been continuously in print since 
the 1950s and 1960s—a great testament to Charles Tuttle’s skill as a 
publisher. More than 60 years aft er its founding, Tuttle Publishing 
is more active today than at any time in its history, still inspired by 
Charles Tuttle’s core mission—to publish fi ne books to span the East 
and West and provide a greater understanding of each.
