A Butterﬂ y for Jane Winchell 
“Th e Janey”
Th is butterfl y is named for the Sara Fraser Robbins Director of the Art and Nature 
Center at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. Janey also curates 
special exhibitions held at the center, and was responsible for “Origami Now!”, a 
show co-curated by Michael LaFosse. It featured cutting-edge origami art on public 
display from June, 2007 through June, 2008. 
Our “Janey” loves her job immensely, and loves her family even more. She is 
bright, learned, and warmhearted, and guides others along the right path to be-
come the same.
