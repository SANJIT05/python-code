Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
10
Poetry for the Fingers
Art in any form helps us cope with daily life. 
Michael’s origami butterfl y designs are “poems for 
the fi ngers,” the folding of which is a particularly 
satisfying blend of relaxation and stimulation. 
Th ere is a beautiful progression of musculoskeletal 
movements that advance naturally, as when keying 
a lyrical passage on a fl ute. You might feel the same 
way when you recite a favorite poem, stanza by 
stanza, or when you control phrasing and breath-
ing to sing a song. If some of today’s complex ori-
gami models are similar to epic novels, then these 
origami butterfl ies are short, sweet, love sonnets. 
To help you relax and enjoy learning these folds, 
we have included a few haiku thoughts for you to 
ponder along the journey.
when you love to sing
sad lyrics are forgotten
happy words burst forth!
when was the last time
you jumped over a puddle
then over a tree?
Th e butterfl y’s metamorphosis symbolizes 
change, and the transformation of a single square 
piece of paper into a beautiful origami butterfl y 
can be as unexpected and wonderful as a real but-
terfl y’s progress as it emerges from a cocoon. 
Prepare for a delightful journey full of sur-
prises! Discover the satisfying shapes and pow-
erful personas of the butterfl ies you create. We 
recall the events that transpired or the places we 
were when we fi rst folded each special origami 
butterfl y, and oft en name them aft er that loca-
tion or occasion. Let each butterfl y remind you of 
happy times and gatherings. Spread the pleasure 
of folding and the joy of serendipity by sharing 
them with your friends. Hold them dearly in your 
hearts as we have!
A Serendipitous Journey
