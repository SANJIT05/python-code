Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
2Dedication
Origami, or paper folding, has been a decorative craft  for hun-
dreds of years, but only recently has it been recognized as a crea-
tive, expressive art. In only the last few decades, a vibrant inter-
national community of origami artists has fl ourished, thanks to 
the help from selfl ess artists, authors, and origami ambassadors. 
Michael LaFosse has designed and named origami butterfl ies to 
honor their pioneering work. While some are still active, others 
have sadly passed from our embrace—but not from our hearts. 
Th is book is lovingly dedicated as a memorial to the contribu-
tions of the late: Akira Yoshizawa, Lillian Oppenheimer, Alice 
Gray, Michael Shall, Eric Joisel, Emiko Kruckner, Killian Mans-
fi eld, Florence Temko, Joyce Rockmore, and V’Ann Cornelius.

Acknowledgments 
We thank Tuttle Publishing for the 
opportunity to revisit our ori-
gami butterfl y designs with both 
diagrams and video instructions to 
make these projects more acces-
sible and enjoyable. We are grateful 
to our editor, Jon Steever, for his 
expert guidance and careful edit-
ing, and to the rest of the talented 
Tuttle team. We gratefully acknowl-
edge the graphics design work of 
Greg Mudarri, who helped us with 
our fi rst book of origami butterfl y 
designs at Origamido Studio, and 
we thank him for his past contribu-
tions and continued friendship. 
Finally, these designs could not 
have been developed without the 
inspirational works of Akira Yoshi-
zawa, who also infl uenced Russell 
Cashdollar. Th eir prior origami 
butterfl y designs provided both 
seed and fertilizer for this Field of 
Discovery!
