A Butterfl y for Tony Cheng
1. Begin with the “Butterﬂ y for Alice Base” 
(pages 35 and 36, steps 1–13). Form a crimped 
overlap at the middle of each wing, by form-
ing new leading edges while rolling the top 
edges and the bottom edges of each wing 
towards the center. (The excess paper rises 
along the center crease.) Use that mountain 
ridge to form an edge, folding the forewing 
paper down over the upper part of the hind-
wing, creating overlap. 
2. Your paper should look like this. Valley-fold 
the indicated edges inward, forming a color 
“V” pattern on each wing. 
3. Mountain- and valley-fold the abdomen 
over the right wing.
4. Valley-fold the left wing to match the right 
wing. Unfold.
5. (A) Squash-fold the paper for the head. (B) 
Mountain-fold the corner behind. (C) Your 
paper should look like this. (D) Fold the wings 
together.
6. (A) Mountain-fold the abdomen edges 
inside. (B) Valley-fold the wings down on 
each side.
