supporter. She knows the best way, and does much of the hard work. Working beside 
her guarantees immense accomplishment. 
helping is the way
of loving your cherished friends!
we are truly blessed!
Th is design will introduce a hybrid design, borrowing the pleasing combination of the fore-
wing from “Th e Alice” (page 34), and the hindwing from “Th e Emiko Fritillary” (page 58).
