13. Use the horizontal crease of the front layer 
to valley-fold the top edge down, while folding 
the left and right corners in as a squash-fold. 
Look ahead at step 14 for the shape.
19. On both forewings, valley-fold the square 
corner so that the top edge runs parallel to 
the crease.
16. One at a time, squash-fold the right and 
left halves of the model to form the wings. 
Look ahead at Step 17.
22. On both hindwings, mountain-fold the 
outside edge behind. Valley-fold the triangle 
ﬂ ap over the hindwing.
14. Valley-fold the left and right edges of the 
front ﬂ ap up, forming a point at the bottom of 
the ﬂ ap.
20. Mountain and valley-fold the triangle 
ﬂ ap into thirds. Inside-reverse fold the lower 
corner of the forewing.
21. Your paper should look like this.
17. Form a crimped overlap at the middle 
of each wing, by rolling the top edges and 
the bottom edges of each wing towards the 
center. (The excess paper pushes up the 
center mountain crease to form an edge.) 
Fold the forewing paper down over the hind-
wing, creating the forewing overlap.
23. One at a time, valley-fold and unfold 
the free edges of the triangle to the bottom 
folded edge.
24. Form a “Rabbit Ear”: Use the creases 
to fold the square corner in half while col-
lapsing the ﬂ ap on top of the hindwing. Look 
ahead for the shape.
15. Valley-fold the bottom corner to the top of 
the split, Unfold.
18. Your paper should look like this.
