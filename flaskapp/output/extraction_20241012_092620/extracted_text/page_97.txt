Michael LaFosse’s Origami Butterfl ies 
94
A Butterﬂ y for June Sakamoto
Th is beautiful butterfl y is named for our longtime friend, and tireless volunteer and organizer for Origami USA, 
and now co-owner of the Mountain-Valley Paper Company in South San Francisco, California. 
Th rough June, we are reminded of the complex, mysterious richness of Japan. Despite strong forces of time and 
circumstance, her embodiment of the subtle strength of Japan keeps reminding us about a diff erent way, a better 
way. While so many people just watch, June will put on the Kimono and make sure that the job gets done right.
prepare for all things
and help whenever able
oh my! Th ey’re here now?
Th is design will introduce folding the square in thirds, as well as fi nishing the hindwings with lovely fanfolds. 
“Th e June”
