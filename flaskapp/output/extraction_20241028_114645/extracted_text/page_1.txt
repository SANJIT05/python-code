Wonders of Nature – Plants 
Nature is full of wonders. Shall we explore some of them?
Lily
The leaf of a lily has a waxy coat on 
the upper surface. It has a notch 
too. Water does not stay on the 
leaf because of the notch and the 
waxy coating. 
The Kurinji or Neelakurinji  shrub is found in the 
Nilgiri mountains in Tamil Nadu.
The ﬂ owers of the Neelakurinji bloom only once in 
12 years.
They are purple blue in colour.  Nilgiri, the Blue 
Mountain, gets its name from these ﬂ owers.
Nuts under the soil
Kurinji
Notch
Usually nuts are seen on the stem part of 
the plant. In groundnut plants, the nuts are 
under the soil.
Nuts are also called seeds.
